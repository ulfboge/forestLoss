I have calculated the area of forest loss using RADD alerts and the Hansen forest loss data. There is a large discrepancy. The Hansen data is around 400 hectares and the radd data around 108 hectares for the same year and same area. Why the large dicrepancy?

The discrepancy between the RADD alerts and Hansen forest loss data can be attributed to several factors, including:

Temporal Resolution: RADD alerts are designed to detect forest loss in near real-time, making it sensitive to small, recent changes. It captures deforestation events with high frequency, which might not fully accumulate when compared over a longer period. On the other hand, Hansen's dataset aggregates annual forest loss based on satellite data over the entire year, which might capture additional forest loss that occurred earlier or later in the year that wasn't detected in the RADD alerts.

Spatial Resolution: RADD alerts, derived from radar data (Sentinel-1), are available at a 10-meter resolution, which might miss smaller-scale disturbances or changes in forest cover due to its different detection approach. Hansen data, based on optical satellite imagery (Landsat), operates at a 30-meter resolution, which could capture slightly different scales of deforestation or forest degradation.

Detection Methods: Hansen's Global Forest Change data relies on optical sensors, which detect forest cover changes based on reflectance changes over time. This method might include more subtle forest cover changes, such as partial canopy loss or degradation. RADD, using radar, primarily detects large-scale structural changes in forests, meaning it might miss partial canopy disturbances that Hansen could capture.

Cloud Cover and Sensor Limitations: Hansen data can be influenced by cloud cover, limiting visibility in certain areas and potentially underestimating forest loss in regions with persistent cloud cover. RADD uses radar, which can penetrate clouds and capture data regardless of weather conditions, potentially making it more reliable in cloudy regions but also potentially missing subtle changes.

Alert Focus: RADD alerts are tuned specifically to detect recent forest disturbance and deforestation events. Hansen’s dataset may include both forest degradation and complete loss over a longer time period, whereas RADD is more focused on rapid deforestation detection, potentially underestimating areas that experience slow degradation.

The combination of these differences in temporal and spatial resolutions, detection methods, and the focus of each dataset could explain the discrepancy in the areas detected for forest loss. For more accuracy, it may help to assess both datasets' underlying algorithms and compare specific regions of forest loss detected by both systems.

I am making a GitHub repository for the rasters, area file and GEE script for deriving the rasters. Could you help me with a description and a text for a readme file for the site?

Here’s a suggestion for the description and README file for your GitHub repository:

Description:
This repository contains the resources and scripts for analyzing forest loss using both RADD alerts and Hansen Global Forest Change datasets. It includes raster files representing forest loss data, an area file defining the geographic extent of analysis, and a Google Earth Engine (GEE) script used to derive the rasters. The analysis focuses on [specify the region or area], highlighting the differences between real-time deforestation alerts (RADD) and annual forest change data (Hansen).

# Forest Loss Analysis: RADD Alerts and Hansen Global Forest Change

This repository contains all the necessary files and code to reproduce the forest loss analysis for [specify the region or area]. The repository includes rasters derived from RADD alerts and Hansen Global Forest Change data, as well as the script used in Google Earth Engine (GEE) to generate the results.

## Repository Contents

- **/rasters/**
  - `radd_forest_loss.tif`: Raster file representing forest loss detected by RADD alerts for the year [specify year].
  - `hansen_forest_loss.tif`: Raster file representing forest loss from the Hansen Global Forest Change dataset for the same year.
  
- **/area_file/**
  - `area_of_interest.shp`: Shapefile containing the boundaries of the area used in this analysis.

- **GEE Script**
  - `forest_loss_analysis.js`: Google Earth Engine script that processes the forest loss data using the RADD alerts and Hansen datasets, filtering by time and region.

## How to Use

1. **Google Earth Engine (GEE) Setup**
   - The analysis can be replicated by using the provided GEE script (`forest_loss_analysis.js`). Make sure you have access to a Google Earth Engine account.
   - Copy the script into your GEE code editor, adjust the area of interest if needed, and run the analysis.
   
2. **Data**
   - The raster files can be downloaded directly from the `/rasters` directory and visualized in any GIS software such as QGIS or ArcGIS.
   
3. **Analysis**
   - The script processes RADD alerts and Hansen data over the same time period to derive forest loss maps, allowing for a comparative analysis of near real-time deforestation alerts vs. annual forest loss measurements.
   
## Dependencies

- Google Earth Engine account.
- GIS software for visualizing the raster files (QGIS, ArcGIS, etc.).
- Earth Engine datasets: 
  - RADD alerts
  - Hansen Global Forest Change (version 2024)
